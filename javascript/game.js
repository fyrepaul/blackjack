  what a game needs.
  1. needs players
    1a. needs to have a definable count of players
    1b. if there is <= 2 players break
    1c. default extra players will be cpu
    1d. needs to interact with players, holding informtion about instanciated self
  2. need players cards.
    1a. a players cards should belong to a player
    1b. if a player has cards make cards viewable
    1c. determin the total value of those cards
  3. define a turn
    1a. possibly define a turn which begins at x (does not matter)
    1b. turns can count to infinity
    1c. when turn loop runs more turn method to mext players
